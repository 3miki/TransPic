        "In this notebook, we'll explore image captioning using PaliGemma, a state-of-the-art vision-language model developed by Google. PaliGemma is designed to understand both images and text, making it ideal for generating accurate and descriptive captions for a wide range of images.\n",
        "\n",
        "Image captioning plays a crucial role in making the web accessible to everyone, particularly individuals who are blind or visually impaired. While alternative text (alt text) provides a concise description of an image, captions offer a more comprehensive explanation, conveying the context, details, and nuances that might be missed in a brief alt text. This ensures that all users, regardless of their visual abilities, can fully understand and appreciate the content of images on websites, contributing to a more inclusive and equitable online experience.\n",

        "Now we'll load the PaliGemma model itself. We'll use a preset configuration to streamline the process and ensure we have a compatible model for image captioning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Today we will be using the **pali_gemma_3b_mix_448** model, which will require our images to be 448x448 pixels... but luckily we can specify this when we load our images later.\n",

        "For future reference, the various presets primarily differ in three aspects:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Image Size:**\n",
        "  - `_224`: trained and expects input images of size 224x224 pixels. This is suitable for smaller images and less computationally demanding.\n",
        "  - `_448`: trained and expects input images of size 448x448 pixels. This offers a balance between detail and computational cost.\n",
        "  - `_896`: trained and expects input images of size 896x896 pixels. This provides the highest level of detail, but is more computationally intensive.\n",
        "2. **Training Type:**\n",
        "  - `_pt`: *pre-trained* on a large dataset of image-text pairs. It's a good starting point for general image captioning tasks.\n",
        "  - `_mix`: *mix fine-tuned* on a diverse set of vision-language tasks. It's expected to perform well on a wider variety of tasks, but is generally intended for research purposes only.\n",
        "3. **Text Sequence Length:** \\\n",
        "This refers to the maximum length of the generated caption. Presets with higher image sizes usually have longer text sequence lengths as they can potentially provide more detailed descriptions.\n",

The backpack is open, revealing the cat's black and white paws and the black strap on the side. The cat's eyes are green, and its whiskers are white. The cat's head is tilted slightly towards the camera, and its ears are perked up. The cat's black and white coat is contrasted by its white chest and paws. The cat's eyes are bright and alert, and its nose is wrinkled in concentration.\n"
